graudit
===============================================================================
graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential 
security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to 
other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while 
keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.

Installation
===============================================================================
Installation can be done as a user or globally as root, simpley run make with
the userinstall or install argument. It is however recommended to use graudit
directly by cloning the git repository as it includes additional database rules
not inlcuded on the distribution files. This also enables you to get updates
between releases. To do this run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/wireghoul/graudit
```

You should also add an alias for graudit in your .profile
```
alias graudit='~/graudit/graudit'
```

Usage
===============================================================================
graudit supports several options and tries to follow good shell practices. For
a list of the options you can run graudit -h or see below. The simplest way to 
use graudit is;

```
graudit [opts] /path/to/scan

OPTIONS
  -d <dbname> database to use or /path/to/file.db (uses default if not specified)
  -A scan ALL files
  -x exclude these files (comma separated list: -x *.js,*.sql)
  -i case in-sensitive scan
  -c <num> number of lines of context to display, default is 2

  -B supress banner
  -L vim friendly lines
  -b colour blind friendly template
  -z supress colors
  -Z high contrast colors
  
  -l lists databases available
  -v prints version number
  -h prints this help screen
```

Databases
===============================================================================
graudit uses extended regular expressions (POSIX) as it's signatures and comes 
with several databases ready for use. You can extend the existing databases or 
make your own if you require additional signatures.

Databases can be loaded from multiple locations, the order of precedence is as
follows:
  1. Custom location specified via the GRDIR environment variable
  2. /usr/share/graudit/
  3. $HOME/.graudit/
  4. A relative signature/ directory from the graudit location
  5. Any file that is specified with a full path, ie: /home/user/my.db
  6. Rules can be read from stdin by supplying - or /dev/stdin as the database

A list of the database files in order of precedence is shown with the -l switch:
`graudit -l`

The following databases are included:
  - actionscript
  - android
  - asp
  - c
  - default (used if -d argument is omitted)
  - dotnet
  - exec
  - fruit
  - ios
  - java
  - js
  - perl
  - php
  - python
  - rough
  - ruby
  - secrets
  - spsqli
  - sql
  - strings
  - xss
